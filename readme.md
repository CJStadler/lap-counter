Lap Counter
===========

An application for lap counting during races (specifically aimed at track races).

Pre-race: 
1. Select the race distance and number of laps.
2. Input a list of the competitors names, hip numbers, and seed times.
	(eventually this should be done just by importing a performance list)
	
Race:
1. Tap "Start" approximately when the race starts (could use mic to pick up gun eventually).
2. Tap each competitor's name as they pass the start line each time.

Ideas:
Colors for leader or top 3?
Colors for lapped?
